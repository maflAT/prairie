Revenge of the Prairie King
===========================

CS50x - Final Project
---------------------

For my final project, I plan to create a 2D-shooter game in Lua 
using the LÃ–VE 2D framework.  
It will be a *twin-stick shooter* kind of game, featuring a top-down perspective.
It is inspired by titles such as *Enter the Gungeon* or more realisticly 
*Journey of the Prairie King*.

I plan to use this awesome Old West style asset pack by [Vaca Roxa](https://twitter.com/bakudas)
that I found on [itch.io](https://bakudas.itch.io/generic-oldwest-pack).  
It features sprites for a player and different mobs with walking and attack 
animations from multiple perspectives.

As a minimum, the game should include the following features:

- Input processing for movement and shooting
- Animated player
- Animated melee enemies
- Collision detection between player and enemies
- Hit detection between bullets and enemies
- Flat, open level with randomly generated highlights
- Win and lose conditions

Depending on how it goes, I might also include some additional features:

- Ranged Enemies
- Ostacles
- Power-Ups
- Multiple maps
- Scrollable maps
